Problem #1     
Block System call : 

- block system call for date command 
- that means you don't have to uninstall date command but if you run kernel must not accept 
- do the same Firefox as well

sol: this can be done with SElinux / secure computing(seccomp). i couldn't figure out how.still searching.
