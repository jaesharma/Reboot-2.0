Problem #5 :  play with files and directories 

  create  3 files named   abc.txt  ok  fine  g.txt  /tmp directory 
  create  4  directories   aa aaa aaaa  under  /tmp directory 
  give ls command to  list the content of  /tmp directory 
  make sure it will only list the content (file|directory)  having 2 char in their name

sol: 
in question 3 directories and 4 files are mentioned so solving on that basis.
	=> creating files and folders:
	cd /tmp
	touch abc.txt ok fine g.txt
	mkdir aa aaa aaaa
	ls | cut -d '.' -f 1 | grep -E '\w{2,}'
